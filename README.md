Requirements
============

You need Isabelle2022 to use this Isabelle library. You can obtain
Isabelle2022 from the [Isabelle website][isabelle].

[isabelle]:

    "Isabelle"


Setup
=====

To make this Isabelle library available to your Isabelle installation,
add the path of the `src` directory to the file
`$ISABELLE_HOME_USER/ROOTS`. You can find out the value of
`$ISABELLE_HOME_USER` by running the following command:

    isabelle getenv ISABELLE_HOME_USER


Building
========

Running `make` builds the PDF file that includes the documentation and
the code and places it in `$ISABELLE_BROWSER_INFO/IOG`. You can find out
the value of `$ISABELLE_BROWSER_INFO` by running the following command:

    isabelle getenv ISABELLE_BROWSER_INFO

The makefile specifies two targets: `properly`, which is the default,
and `qnd`. With `properly`, fake proofs (`sorry`) are not accepted; with
`qnd`, quick-and-dirty mode is used and thus fake proofs are accepted.
